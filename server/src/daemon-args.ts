/**
 * The daemon's OWN command-line flags, and the guard that keeps them out of the CLI dispatcher.
 *
 * server/src/index.ts hands ANY argv beyond the program name to the CLI, which answers and exits
 * without ever starting a server. That was safe while every launcher was bare — the tray, dev.ts
 * and the auto-update relaunch all respawned with no verb — and it is exactly why the relaunch
 * could only ever pass information through the environment.
 *
 * The environment is not good enough for the relaunch anymore. It is handed to WMI
 * Win32_Process.Create on win32 (see buildDetachedSpawn), which takes a command LINE and does NOT
 * inherit the caller's environment block, so an env-only handover reaches the transient
 * powershell.exe and never the successor daemon. Going through WMI is what gets the successor OUT
 * of the predecessor's process tree, so a tray Quit (`taskkill /T /F`) landing in the ~800ms
 * handoff can no longer kill both. So the successor's port and relaunch signal have to be
 * arguments, and arguments have to stop meaning "this is a CLI invocation".
 *
 * parseDaemonArgs is deliberately all-or-nothing: it returns null the moment it sees a token it
 * does not own, so anything that is not exclusively daemon flags still reaches the CLI untouched.
 * Every CLI verb is a bare word (`start`, `list`, `mcp`, …) or `--version`/`--help`, none of which
 * this recognises, so no existing invocation changes meaning.
