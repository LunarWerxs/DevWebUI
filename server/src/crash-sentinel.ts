// Crash sentinel + safe mode.
//
// WHY: the tray host revives a daemon that dies, and a booting daemon auto-starts the user's dev
// servers (autoStartOnLaunch, the auto-update resume list). When one of those starts is what
// takes the daemon down, every revive repeats it, and there was no quiet way back in. So every
// launch drops `<dataDir>/.sentinel/run_<launch-id>` and a CLEAN shutdown removes it again: a run
// file still on disk at the next boot means the previous daemon never got to shut down. That boot
// then comes up in SAFE MODE - projects load, nothing auto-starts - and the GUI offers
// "Restart normally" plus a link to the de-duplicated crash entry this records.
//
// A run file whose pid is still alive is a sibling, not a crash: the auto-update successor boots
// while its predecessor is still handing over the port, so it must not read that file as a
// crash (and must not delete it: the predecessor removes its own on the way out).
// Best-effort throughout: a sentinel that cannot be written must never stop the daemon booting.
